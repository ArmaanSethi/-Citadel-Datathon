# Citadel-Datathon
* Our team set out to address the question of how to minimize time spent searching for parking.
*To accomplish this, we utilized the vehicle activity dataset, particularly the data pertaining to parking location coordinates (geohashes) and average time taken to search for parking.
*The product of all of our code is in the report.
